The microMathematics is the world's first mathematical
calculator on Android oriented around a spreadsheet that allows live editing of
mathematical identities combined with highly accurate computations.

It is based on a powerful touch-screen editor that allows users to create and
manipulate naturally readable worksheets containing all basic mathematical
notations.

The microMathematics supports school-level of mathematical calculations.
This version has following mathematical limitations: it does not support special
functions, vectors, matrices, integration, differentiation, units and many
other things from high-level mathematics.
